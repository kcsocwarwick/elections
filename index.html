          <h3>Why be a Part of the KCSOC Team?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            KCSOC is unlike any other society at university. Feeding our
            spiritual needs and taking people on a journey of self-realisation
            is a big part of the KCSOC mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            By being a part of the team, you'll gain a deeper sense of who you
            are along with other like-minded people. It will be a chance to make
            a difference by bringing the philosophy of KC into their lives. We
            can't wait for you to be part of this amazing family!
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Application Process</h3>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>

              <a href="#apply">apply below</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the last week of term, on the 17th of March, we will hold
              elections instead of the usual Thursday talk. You will have an
              opportunity to give a short 2 minute presentation. We're looking
              for you to discuss:
              <ul>
                <br />
                <li>Why you became a part of KCSOC</li>
                <li>Why you have applied to the role</li>
                <li>
                  What are you looking to gain from being part of the team
                </li>
                <li>Anything else you want to add</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />We'll also ask you a couple questions after your presentation,
          but it will be super casual, so nothing to worry about! If you'd like
          to have slides, please send them to:
          <a href="mailto:kcsoc.warwick.elections@gmail.com"
