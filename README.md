Wesbite for info and forms to apply for KCSOC elections built using Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS.

The JS files are adapted from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-to-send-email-via-google-script-html-no-server) - they use Google Scripts to process the form data, save it to Google Sheets and send an automatic confirmation email.
